# The Changes In This Fork

This fork of kubernetes-the-hard-way tutorial aims to introduce changes that would be suitable in terms of system administration. The most basic difference will be using the package managers instead of pre-built binaries and manual installation. This would bring the ubernetes installation closer to a production environment.

# Prerequisites

## Google Cloud Platform

This tutorial leverages the [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/) to streamline provisioning of the compute infrastructure required to bootstrap a Kubernetes cluster from the ground up. [Sign up](https://cloud.google.com/free/) for $300 in free credits.

[Estimated cost](https://cloud.google.com/products/calculator/#id=78df6ced-9c50-48f8-a670-bc5003f2ddaa) to run this tutorial: $0.22 per hour ($5.39 per day).

> The compute resources required for this tutorial exceed the Google Cloud Platform free tier.

## Google Cloud Platform SDK

### Install the Google Cloud SDK

Follow the Google Cloud SDK [documentation](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) to install and configure the `gcloud` command line utility.

Verify the Google Cloud SDK version is 218.0.0 or higher:

```
gcloud version
```

### Set a Default Compute Region and Zone

> Use the `gcloud compute zones list` command to view additional regions and zones.

This tutorial assumes a default compute region and zone have been configured.

If you are using the `gcloud` command-line tool for the first time `init` is the easiest way to do this:

```
gcloud init
```

Check the default compute region:

```
gcloud config get-value compute/region
```

Otherwise set a default compute region:

```
gcloud config set compute/region europe-west1
```

Check the default compute zone:

```
gcloud config get-value compute/zone
```

Set a default compute zone:

```
gcloud config set compute/zone europe-west1-b
```

## Running Commands in Parallel with tmux

[tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux/wiki) can be used to run commands on multiple compute instances at the same time. Labs in this tutorial may require running the same commands across multiple compute instances, in those cases consider using tmux and splitting a window into multiple panes with `synchronize-panes` enabled to speed up the provisioning process.

> The use of tmux is optional and not required to complete this tutorial.

> Enable `synchronize-panes`: `ctrl+b` then `shift :`. Then type `set synchronize-panes on` at the prompt. To disable synchronization: `set synchronize-panes off`.
